# chess-bot
After watching people create chess bots, there seen to be some assumptions that people are making without addressing them.
In this chess bot, I want to explore and challenge these assumptions to see if any approvements can be made.
Futhermore, this would just be a fun exercise to improve on my data usage and optimizations in python.
